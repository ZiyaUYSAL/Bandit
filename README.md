- How to open a "-" dashed filename using terminal
- This type of approach has a lot of misunderstanding because using - as an argument refers to <b>STDIN/STDOUT</b> i.e <b>dev/stdin</b> or <b>dev/stdout</b> .So if you want to open this type of file you have to specify the full location of the file such as <b>./-</b> .For eg. , if you want to see what is in that file use <b>cat ./-</b>
